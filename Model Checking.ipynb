    "SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) is a problem that tries to find a satisfying assignment to variables such that some expression evaluates to _true_. For example, the `a*a + b*b = c*c` expressions evaluates to _true_ (is _satisfiable_ (**SAT**)) if `a := 3, b:= 4, c := 5` (but other _satisfying_ assignments exist), and `a <= 0 && a >= 1` has no such assignment, therefore, is _unsatisfiable_ (**UNSAT**).

    "\n",
    "Using Python, we can declare **variables** (or constants, if you prefer) using the type name as a constructor. As a convention, the solver variable is usually assigned to a Python variable of the same name, which is later used to construct expressions. The available sorts include the ones introduced in the various SMT-LIB theories (integers, floating points, arrays, ...). \n",

    "Pay attention to the definition of integers. In the Integer SMT Theory, integers are _mathematical_, i.e., have no upper or lower bound. When we model integers from programming languages, we usually rely on _bitvector_ types, which are fix-width integers. Bit-vector variables are declared by adding the bit-width as a second argument."
